## Description
File *.1337 is generated by [x64dbg](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg), telling that the byte from RVA should be changed to the other.    
It is human-readable and used to clearly show the patches for raw file.    

File format:
```
>010editor.exe              # raw file
00000000001E4188:0F->E9     # RVA:from_byte->to_byte
...
```
File *.patch is generated by [bsdiff](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff) and used by bspatch to patch raw file.
